<!--
<style> Note: YOU MAY NOT STYLE PAGES other than using a border or simple flow to provide a base page structure.  If you have more than 3 CSS properties (total, not unique) in your file you will be deducted points.  Your effort here is to style your pages.

<script> Note: You may add script as a placeholder, to show the use of a third party script for analytics, or for use with a tag that we have permitted the use of JS for (e.g. the Canvas tag).  No interactions are allowed at this stage otherwise you will be deducted points. 

<canvas> Note: To demonstrate the use of a <canvas> tag you may include some MINOR AMOUNT of JavaScript.  You are simply exploring the idea of the tag.  If you have more than 15 lines of script to do something assume you did too much.

<svg> Note: To demonstrate you can use SVG within an HTML page demonstrate this element within inline tag usage.
